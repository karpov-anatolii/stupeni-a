      <h2 class="faq">What is the term for making concrete stairs for a house? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> The main stages of construction of concrete stairs for a house by the company Stairs-A (without finishing) are as follows: <br> &nbsp; 1. Meeting with the customer at the site, taking measurements of the building layout. - 1 day. <br> &nbsp; 2. Designing stairs and sending 3d visualization (computer design) to the customer's mail - 1-2 days. <br> &nbsp; 3. Arrival of the team to the object, production of formwork, reinforcement and pouring of concrete stairs - 4-7 days. <br> &nbsp; 4. After 2 weeks, removing the formwork of the concrete stairs and grinding the steps - 14 days. <br> 8 days after the first meeting (item 1), you can already move on the stairs filled with concrete (the concrete sets in 1 day), and after another 2 weeks you can start processing the stairs. <br> Summary: the term for making concrete stairs for a house is 22 days. </h3>

    <div class="faq_div">
      <h2 class="faq">What is the weight of concrete stairs? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> Smooth-lined concrete stairs for a house weigh approximately 2000-2500 kg. <br> Tative transparent and kosour stairs weigh approximately 1000-1200 kg. <br> If to calculate the pressure on the floor, for example, take round hollow plates PC 60 -12-12.5 (length 5980mm, width 1190mm, height 220mm and calculated load 1250 kgf / m2), then for such a plate (taking into account the screed, covering the floor, partitions, temporary load from people) you can install 4 smoothly hemmed and 8 string stairs! And this is without taking into account the fact that monolithic concrete stairs transfer part of their load to the upper floor, to which they are anchored, and not simply supported. And if the stairs are wall-mounted, then part of the load is also transferred to the wall (if the wall is load-bearing).</h3>

    <div class="faq_div">
      <h2 class="faq">Does Stair-A work with customer materials? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> We are ready to buy building materials (separate items) from you, if they have been prepared in advance and if they correspond to our purchase price and correspond to the quality. All these actions are discussed in advance before the construction of the stairs and are written down in the contract. <br> Please do not ask the question "How much do the materials cost separately and how much does the work cost?", because such concepts do not exist in Shkodi-A!</h3>

    <div class="faq_div">
      <h2 class="faq">What are the tolerances in the geometry of stairs? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> Company Shkody-A observes the following tolerances when manufacturing concrete stairs: <br> Horizontal tolerance of 3 mm for polished treads. <br> For all other elements, the horizontal and vertical tolerance is 5 mm.</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq_div">
      <h2 class="faq">What's in the contract? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> Company Shhody-A conducts business in Kyiv and throughout Ukraine as SPD. There is a current account. The contract package includes: <br> &nbsp; 1. Plan of stairs. <br> &nbsp; 2. Sections of stairs. <br> &nbsp; 3. Visualization of stairs (3-4 types). <br> &nbsp; 4. The contract itself.</h3>

    <div class="faq_div">
      <h2 class="faq">What brand of concrete? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> For pouring concrete stairs with a volume of 2 cubic meters or more, the Shhody-A company uses imported commercial concrete of the B25 P3 brand. In other cases, concrete is made on site by hand with a grade close to B25 P3.</h3>

      <h2 class="faq">Is it possible to strengthen the reinforcement of concrete stairs? </H2>
      <H3 class="answ"> The designers of Stair-A calculate the stairs and its separate nodes in accordance with all the laws of resistance of materials, construction mechanics and DBN. Since 2011, we have accumulated a large database of ordinary standard stairs, from where we take reinforcement schemes. For non-standard types of stairs, we make an individual engineering calculation. Trust our specialists, let them decide how much and what type of fittings to put in the stairs.</h3>

      <h2 class="faq">What is the payment scheme and is prepayment required? </H2>

An advance of UAH 1,000 for project work (plan, sections and visualization). <br> &nbsp; 2. Advance payment of 50% of the cost of the stairs on the day of arrival at the Customer's facility (after arrival with building materials and before the start of work). <br> &nbsp; 3. Immediately after pouring the stairs with concrete, the Customer pays another tranche of 30% of the cost of the stairs. <br> &nbsp; 4. After removing the formwork and accepting the work, the Customer pays the remaining 20% of the cost of the stairs minus an advance of UAH 1,000, which was issued at the very beginning.</h3>
