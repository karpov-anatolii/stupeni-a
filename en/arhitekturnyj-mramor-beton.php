<p>In 2020, the company "Stairs-A" developed a unique technology for the production of <strong> artificial marble </strong> from reactive powder concrete. We call it <strong>architectural marble-concrete</strong> (AMC).</br>

Reactive powder concretes (RPCs) are concretes of the future that do not contain coarse-grained and lumpy fillers. </br>
The high fluidity of RPB allows you to use them for self-compacting high-strength concrete.
  Extremely high strength of RPB, reaching 120-160 MPa., Low water absorption (less than 1%), high frost resistance (more than 1000 cycles),
  high axial tensile strength (10-15 MPa) and bending strength (40-50 MPa) and high impact strength open up new opportunities for
production of new high-strength finishing materials and in making a technical and economic breakthrough in concrete technology.
For comparison, the average compressive strength of ordinary concrete M400 (B30) is 39.2 MPa, and this indicator is three times inferior to reactive powder concrete.
That is why the company "Shodinka-A" chose RPB as a raw material for the production of AMB with subsequent <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> cladding of concrete stairs </a>.
The engineers of "Stairs-A" considered all the nuances of using architectural marble-concrete as steps and landings of <strong> concrete stairs </strong>, namely: </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - all elements are covered with high-quality polyurethane varnish, which prevents the foot from slipping on the marble step. Polyurethane is used as a substitute for rubber, so your foot will never slip off the step.
  as it often happens on natural marble and granite stairs. At the same time, the process of grinding and polishing polyurethane varnish creates a high degree of gloss and makes our steps very similar to natural stone. </br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; - steps are reinforced with composite reinforcement for additional strength. </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - to avoid microcracks, we reinforce our artificial marble with polypropylene fiber. </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; - on the back side of the steps there are honeycomb recesses for better adhesion of the glue with the step. </br> </br>

Color variations of architectural marble-concrete are practically unlimited - we can choose any color range to order.
  White marble with gray veins, white-turquoise marble with yellow and dark green veins, white marble with golden-dark-gray veins - we will make everything that your imagination suggests!

 We would like to familiarize you with our rules and options <strong> facing concrete stairs </strong> AMB. </br>
&nbsp; 1. All prices and the cost calculation algorithm are listed in <a href="stoimost-oblicovki-mramorom.php" target="_blank"><u> MENU >> PRICE >> Cost of facing with architectural marble-concrete.</u> </a> </br>
&nbsp; 2. The price list indicates the price for the manufacture of facing elements (steps, risers, plinth, platform), plus an additional 30% (of the manufacturing price) for the installation of these elements. </br>
&nbsp; 3. Advance payment for the production of cladding elements is 100%. Installation work (+ 30%) is paid in 2 installments: half before the start of installation work and half at the end of all work. </br>
&nbsp; 4. You can order from us only the production of cladding elements without installation. In this case, you must provide us with models of the stairs. How to do it, see our video MODELS of stairs. </br>
&nbsp; 5. Our unique technology allows us to produce even curved marble slabs. The steps for inviting (curvilinear) steps will be made integrally from 1 or 2 elements, and not from many threaded pieces, as in the old way. This gives integrity and monumentality to the stairs. And a curved plinth is indispensable in the presence of curved walls and columns. </br>

</div>
&nbsp; 6. <Strong> Architectural marble-concrete </strong> can also be used on the street in the exterior, as powdered concrete has high frost resistance, and polyurethane varnish is not afraid of ultraviolet light and does not turn yellow like epoxy.
  But in this case, polyurethane varnish will quickly lose its gloss from street shoes. This can be corrected by re-varnishing and polishing. </br> </br>
<big> Architectural marble-concrete is a new generation marble that has the beauty of natural marble and the strength of concrete of the future!</big>   </p>  </br></br>
