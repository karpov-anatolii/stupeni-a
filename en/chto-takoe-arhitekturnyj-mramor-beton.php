    <p>Time runs forward with acceleration and new technologies are invented in the construction industry and new finishing materials are introduced.
      This is how the world works, and what used to seem like a fantasy is now a reality!
      The company "Stairs-A" has developed a new concept for the production of <strong> marble-concrete </strong>. And she didn't just develop it, but successfully implemented it in her projects! </br> </br>

      So, what is <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/arhitekturnyj-mramor-beton.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> OUR MARBLE-CONCRETE </a> and its unique properties: </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. High-strength reactive powder concrete with the addition of various pigments, polypropylene fiber and composite reinforcement. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Selection of any color gamut of <strong> marble-concrete </strong> at the customer's order. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Anti-slip coating of stairs with polyurethane varnish, followed by grinding and polishing. Absorption of accidentally spilled liquids into the marble-concrete surface is excluded. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;4. Production of elements of any curvilinear shape - both with a patterned contour (patterned treads of inviting steps) and with the bend of the entire element (treads of patterned stairs). </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;5. The price of marble-concrete is affordable, which is 1.5-2 times cheaper than natural stone. </br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;6. The increased bending strength of marble-concrete due to fiber and composite reinforcement allows its use on <strong> cantilever </strong> and <strong> kosour stairs </strong>, where a priori there is a deflection of the steps when walking. </br> </br>

      The production of marble from concrete is actively developing all over the world, there are many practices and technologies. But, as our monitoring showed,
      only the company "Stairs-A" managed to develop the most realistic <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> marble from concrete </a> and apply it for lining <strong> concrete stairs </strong>. Our <strong> artificial marble </strong> is practically indistinguishable from the real thing.
