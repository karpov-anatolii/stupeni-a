    <h2>Concrete staircases</h2>
    <p>Currently, we most often choose <strong> concrete stairs </strong> finished with stone, tiles or wood.
      A significant advantage of concrete stairs is their very high strength and bearing capacity compared to wooden structures. The manufacturing technology of typical concrete stairs varies slightly depending on the contractor. <br /> <br />
      Another advantage of concrete stairs is their high fire resistance. As a result, the safety of people living in the house increases.
      Concrete stairs do not look aesthetically pleasing, so it is necessary to properly process them. Most often, this is cladding the stairs with wood, ceramic tiles or stone. <br /> <br />
      The type of stairs depends not only on the individual wishes of the customer, but also on the specifics of the building and premises. <Strong> Concrete stairs </strong> can be chosen for large, spacious houses where the open space is the dominant element - such stairs will not overload the interior and will become its elegant addition. <br /> <br />
      <strong> Concrete stairs </strong> can be adapted to different styles - it is a matter of individual assessment of the customer. In a modern or minimalist design, a concrete structure is best. <br /> <br />
      Many people associate classically decorated interiors with impressive wooden stairs, no less good effect can be obtained by using architectural concrete for stairs.<br /><br />
      <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/uk-ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concrete stairs</a> do not necessarily have to be a heavy and bulky structure, modern <em> stairs made of concrete </em> are designed according to new technologies, thanks to which there is room for a comfortable sofa or armchair, a stylish bookcase, a practical wardrobe or a chest of drawers. Concrete stairs in combination with wooden finishing acquire an elegant look, which makes them ideal for interiors in a classic style. Stairs on the side kosour and cantilever stairs are the most visually light, and their design allows you to transfer all the load to the wall, excluding the calculation of the overlap of the first and second floors, which is important if the house has wooden floors.
