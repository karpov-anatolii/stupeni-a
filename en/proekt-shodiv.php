              <h2 class="title-description font-poppins">A typical project of concrete monolithic stair for a house from the company "Stairs-A"</h2><br><br>

              <p>In this article, we will consider a typical staircase project, the calculations of which were performed in PC LIRA-SAPR. <br>
                    It is very important that the calculations of the programs "SCAD" or "LIRA-SAPR" are included in the project, since they calculate all the stresses that arise in concrete stairs and the structures on which they rest. And it is these programs that give the required area of reinforcement for the upper and lower reinforcement grids of the stairs. If your project does not have an RSN table, there are no isofields of stresses and displacements, and there is no design option from the "SCAD" or "Lira" programs, then your architect simply took the reinforcement "by eye". Also, the calculation of shakiness (shaking of stairs) must be added to the calculation of any stairs, and is impossible without a software calculation. <br>
                    Entrust the work to professionals! You can order a concrete staircase project right now by calling +38-096-933-63-33.

                    We will omit the first two pages (Cover and Title page) and start with page №2 - Details of working drawings.

              <p>But first, the geometry of the stairs and the room itself are built in the ArchiCad program.
