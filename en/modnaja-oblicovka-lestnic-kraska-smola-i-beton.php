    <p>There are many combinations of finishing solutions for <strong> concrete stairs </strong>. Different materials can be used, such as resin, concrete or paint. They are actively used in modern interior design trends.

      Steps and under-stairs can be finished with the same material, but you can distinguish it by color, for example, choose wood of different species. In both places, you can also use different materials, for example, finish the top of the stairs with wood, and the steps - with ceramics or wear-resistant paint. If <strong> concrete stairs </strong> are adjacent to the wall, you also need to think about how to finish them with a plinth. It is important where the railing is attached and what material it will be made of. </br> </br>

      <big> Paint for stairs. </big> </br>

      <strong> Stairs </strong> treated in this way are becoming more and more popular thanks to the appearance on the market of products that allow you to create surfaces that are very strong, durable and resistant to damage and at the same time beautiful. In this case, the issue of perfect smoothness of the surface is extremely important. The paints applied to the stairs are very thin - only from 0.2 to 0.5-1 mm. It is good to choose products with anti-slip additives. The simplest and cheapest is to paint the stairs two or three times with epoxy paint for concrete. This finish will be the thinnest. You can do it yourself. </br> </br>

      <big> Resin for stairs. </big> </br>

      A much stronger, but also more expensive solution is to make the floor on the <em> stairs </em> from plastic. For this, it is better to hire a professional team, because knowledge of technologies is required. The stairs can be coated with epoxy, polyurethane or methacrylic resin. It consists of two main layers and two or three layers of top coating. Due to the drying time of the material, successive layers are applied day after day (only methacrylic can be used in several layers in one day, but it is much more expensive). </br> </br>

      <big>Decorative decoration <strong> concrete stairs. </strong> </big> </br>

      Pigments, decorative stripes or small mineral fillers can be added to the polymer floor to give the surface an original look. Each layer of the polymer floor is polished. The result is a very smooth coating. Over time, small scratches may appear on it, which will add a matte effect. You can then order the coating to be renewed by sanding. Microcement is a new and interesting material, the ingredient of which is also resin. However, it contains additive cement, modifiers and fillers. The microcement coating is thicker - 2-3 mm - and can be shaped arbitrarily using various tools. <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Stairs </a> will have a very interesting finish, but it will be more difficult to keep them clean.
