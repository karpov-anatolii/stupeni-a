      Do you want to make <a href="https://stupeni-a.com.ua/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> concrete stairs</a> for your private home, but don't know where to start?
      Would you like to start your business <strong>production of concrete stairs</strong>?
      This video is especially for you! We will teach you not only the correct process of making smooth-hewn stairs, but also show you how to make all the elements for universal and <strong> reusable formwork</strong>.
      The versatility of the formwork consists in the production of smoothly hemmed curved stairs of any shape in plan, any width of the march and height of the stairs.
      Multiple use of the formwork will not only save you money on the purchase of new plywood, timber and boards, but will also significantly reduce the time for erecting the formwork.
      Our company "Stairs-A" has developed a unique <strong>formwork construction</strong> technology for pouring concrete smooth-lined stairs, which has helped us for many years to build<strong> stairs</strong> with minimal costs only for reinforcement and concrete.
      We do not spend money on formwork at all!
      With an average cost of U-shaped smooth-hewn stairs of $1,000, the cost of materials and formwork is usually $400, of which $200 goes to formwork (plywood, boards, timber).
      Our technology will help you save $200 on each flight of stairs!
      The basis of the technology is the use of galvanized sheet metal 1 mm thick to form the curved surface of the formwork.
      Triangular segments of 4 types are cut out of tin, from which the formwork of the lower part of the march is stitched. Tin is much stronger and more flexible than plywood, and its small thickness allows you to twist segments with overlapping self-tapping screws.
      After removing the formwork, there are notches of 1-2 mm, which are easily filled with painters.


      The video lesson describes in detail everything from the very beginning<strong> construction of concrete stairs</strong>, namely from the marking of the stairs on the floor and on the walls according to the plan of the staircase project. You can also order a staircase project from us.
      In the video there are many drawings with detailed dimensions of all formwork elements. We will gladly answer all your questions on Viber +380993800661 or WhatsApp +380969336333.
      The cost of the video lesson is $100. For purchase, write in Viber or WhatsApp to the numbers indicated above.

      Modern realities dictate new working conditions for us - we are constantly looking for ways to reduce production costs and speed up the construction process.
